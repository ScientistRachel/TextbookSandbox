# Extending Your Hardware With AI
<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: This image restoration focused chapter motivates how AI can improve the image quality beyond hardware limitations. This chapter should include image restoration (denoising) and sensor-less AO (deep-learning-based AO); other topics can be included at the authorâ€™s discretion.

Notes from the authors' meeting: This chapter can start with a broader overview of the topic, which will reference existing reviews on the topic. Then the chapter will focus on a denoising tutorial, which will include discussions of potential pitfalls and best practices.
