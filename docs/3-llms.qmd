# Promise and Pitfalls of Large Language Models
<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 3 addresses use-cases of large language models for microscopists. It should discuss microscopy-specific tools (e.g., Omega, BioImage.io chatbot) as well as using general tools like Chat-GPT. It should describe how to use chatbots to learn about imaging and analysis, to generate code snippets, and others, with a focus on the potential pitfalls of using these tools.
