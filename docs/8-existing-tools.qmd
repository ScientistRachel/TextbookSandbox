# Finding and Using Existing Tools
<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 8 should discuss pre-existing tools that do not require programming knowledge. The chapter should start with a brief discussion of what to consider when searching for pre-trained models and software packages on sites (e.g., BioImage Model Zoo, Bioimage Informatics Index (BIII), image.sc). This should be followed by a discussion of a few specific tools (e.g., CellProfiler, Cellpose, ImageJâ€™s Weka Segmentation), highlighting what to look for in a tool, potential pitfalls, etc.
