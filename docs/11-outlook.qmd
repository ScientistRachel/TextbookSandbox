<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 11 concludes the book with a forward-looking assessment of AI in microscopy, focusing on how it can/will enable biological discovery. It should highlight a few motivational examples of discoveries that AI has already enabled and discuss opportunities to which the reader is primed to contribute after reading this book.
