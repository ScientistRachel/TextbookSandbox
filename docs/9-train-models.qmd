# Training and Using Your Own Models
<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 9 discusses the considerations (e.g., over/under-fitting, parameter choices) for training a new model and tools to help getting started (e.g. DL4MicEverywhere). It should include a primer on cloud-based computing tools such as Docker, Google Colab, etc. to highlight the potential for training models without bespoke hardware in house. This chapter should demonstrate a walk-through of training a model for segmentation, following the throughline of the book.
