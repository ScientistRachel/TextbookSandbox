# Architectures and Loss Models
<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 4 introduces architectures and loss models, defining them and providing examples through two practical case studies: image restoration and segmentation. Although this chapter will include code snippets/exercises, the presentation of essential concepts should communicate the philosophy behind the choice of a model for non-programmers.
