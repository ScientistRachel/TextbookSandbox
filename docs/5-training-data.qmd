# Training Data
<!--Your first header will be the chapter's upper-level table of contents title.-->
<!--If you'd like to have a subtitle, include it in the Quarto header above -->

Under your first header, include a brief introduction to your chapter.

Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 5 discusses collecting, annotating and validating training data. It should highlight potential pitfalls such as balanced data sets, out-of-distribution problems, etc. It should also address the question: how do you collect training data on your microscope? For example, this chapter should discuss collecting low/high-laser power pairs for the purpose of training an image restoration model.
