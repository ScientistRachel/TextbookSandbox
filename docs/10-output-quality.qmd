Starting prompt for this chapter: Chapter 10 addresses how to assess the quality of a modelâ€™s output, mentioning Metrics Reloaded. This chapter should address the question: how do I know my model is good enough? It should frame this discussion using the example of a segmentation model and discuss how tools can identify uncertain decisions from a model.
